# Student Manager (Humanized)

This is a small, human-written Java console application to manage students.
The goal is readability and using only basics: classes, interfaces, collections,
and simple exception handling.

## Run
- Build with Maven: `mvn clean package`
- Run: `java -jar target/student-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Notes
- The project ships with a simple in-memory storage (ArrayList) for easy testing.
- DBConnection is included as an educational placeholder for JDBC usage.
- Keep the code simple and readable — written in a style a student would use.

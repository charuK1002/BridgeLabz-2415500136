Write a program that takes a year as input and outputs the Year is a Leap Year or not 
Hint => 
The LeapYear program only works for year >= 1582, corresponding to a year in the Gregorian calendar. 
Also Leap year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400
Write a method to check for Leap Year using the conditions a and b

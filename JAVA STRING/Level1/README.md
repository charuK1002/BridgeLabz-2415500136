# JAVA STRING Level 1 Project

This project contains a series of Java programs that demonstrate various string manipulations and exception handling techniques. Each program is designed to illustrate specific concepts related to string processing in Java.

## File Descriptions

1. **CompareStrings.java**: 
   - This program compares two strings using the `charAt()` method and checks the result with the built-in `String.equals()` method. It includes methods for user input and comparison logic.

2. **CreateSubstring.java**: 
   - This program creates a substring from a string using the `charAt()` method. It also utilizes the built-in `substring()` method to compare the results and display them.

3. **StringToCharArray.java**: 
   - This program returns all characters in a string without using the `toCharArray()` method. It compares the result with the built-in `toCharArray()` method and displays the comparison.

4. **NullPointerDemo.java**: 
   - This program demonstrates a `NullPointerException`. It includes methods to generate and handle the exception using try-catch blocks.

5. **StringIndexOutOfBoundsDemo.java**: 
   - This program demonstrates a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. It includes methods to generate and handle the exception using try-catch blocks.

6. **IllegalArgumentDemo.java**: 
   - This program demonstrates an `IllegalArgumentException`. It includes methods to generate and handle the exception using try-catch blocks.

7. **NumberFormatDemo.java**: 
   - This program demonstrates a `NumberFormatException`. It includes methods to generate and handle the exception using try-catch blocks.

8. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsDemo.java**: 
   - This program demonstrates an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. It includes methods to generate and handle the exception using try-catch blocks.

9. **ToUpperCaseDemo.java**: 
   - This program converts a complete text to uppercase using the `charAt()` method. It compares the results with the built-in `toUpperCase()` method.

10. **ToLowerCaseDemo.java**: 
    - This program converts a complete text to lowercase using the `charAt()` method. It compares the results with the built-in `toLowerCase()` method.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `Level1` directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the desired Java file using the command:
   ```
   javac <FileName>.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled Java program using the command:
   ```
   java <FileName>
   ```

Replace `<FileName>` with the name of the Java file you wish to run (without the `.java` extension).

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical demonstration of string manipulation techniques and exception handling in Java. Each program is designed to be self-contained and illustrates specific concepts that are fundamental to understanding Java programming.
